                Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which
                is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
                game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of
                the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six
                times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the
                pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler
                unfairly bowls the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends
                of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each
                batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
                when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit
                ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line
                in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams
                swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more runs wins, provided that the other team has
                completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and
                match referee in international matches.</p>
