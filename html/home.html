    <h1>sports</h1>
    <p>sports, physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail.
         Sports are part of every culture past and present,
         but each culture has its own definition of sports.
          The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship 
          of sports to play, games, and contests. “Play,” 
          wrote the German theorist Carl Diem, “is purposeless activity,
           for its own sake, the opposite of work.” Humans work because 
           they have to; they play because they want to. Play is autotelic—that is, 
           it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced. Recalcitrant children 
           compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game of football 
           (soccer) are not really engaged in a sport.l̥</p>
