    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Due to the success of the first 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Canada, a meeting of representatives from
        Great Britain, its dominions, colonies and territories decided that the games, similar to the Olympic Games
        should be held every four years, and that an authoritative organisation should be formed. Following the 1932
        Summer Olympics, it was decided to form the "British Empire Games Federation" who would be responsible for the
        organising of the games. The name of the federation was changed in 1952 to the "British Empire and Commonwealth
        Games Federation", and again in Jamaica in 1966 to the "British Commonwealth Games Federation", until eventually
        being changed again in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1974 to the "Commonwealth Games Federation".</p>
